Unified Analytics with Dremio unlocks the ability to streamline your data workflows by providing a single, cohesive platform for querying and analyzing data across multiple sources. Dremio's dbt integration not only orchestrates SQL workflows but also enables seamless synchronization of documentation and tags directly with Dremio, ensuring that your data assets are well-organized and discoverable. With the ability to run tests, model across various Dremio-supported data sources, and define incremental pipelines, you can build robust and scalable analytics processes. Moreover, this integration allows you to define and optimize reflections directly in your dbt models, accelerating query performance while maintaining consistency and governance across your datasets. This combination of Dremio and dbt creates a powerful toolkit for curating a unified, efficient, and high-performance analytics environment.

This course will introduce you to the basics of using dbt and Dremio together. You will learn how to create and define your resources, and some best practices for executing. During these sessions you will learn about:
  - Creating and configuring dbt projects
  - Data Sources and Data Models
  - Materializing data as Views and Tables
  - Creating documentation and tests within dbt
  - Synching documentation with Dremio
  - Creating Reflections within dbt
